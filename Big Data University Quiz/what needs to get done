ok so far you've been able to:
made the app load the correct course
made the app rotate questions
made the app be able to tell which is the right answer

what needs to be done:
you need to add a back button to return to the screen (nav controller)
you need to create another view that leads to the big data university website (maybe make a popup that links to the BDU website)
clean up the UI/UX
